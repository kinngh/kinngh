#### I've deleted / archived most of my repositories as I'm in the middle of refactoring my GitHub presence.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am [Harshdeep Singh Hura](https://harshdeephura.com) a Pastry Chef, Entrepreneur, [TEDx Speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty-inz18kzQ), Programmer and Designer! 

Starting out as an iOS developer, I scaled my app WrapItUp to 3M+ users without a single dollar in marketing! Read more about it on my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@kinngh/refusing-20m-in-acquisition-1-5m-users-and-the-story-of-how-i-built-it-all-for-99-year-1351e624e62f?source=---------3------------------).

I love writing JavaScript Full Stack Applications using the MERNG Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node and GraphQL). I also have a huge focus on building solutions and themes on Shopify.

Apart from programming, I jump off cliffs and bake (I am a Pastry Chef).
