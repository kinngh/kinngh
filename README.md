### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Harshdeep Singh Hura or Kinngh almost everywhere on the Internet! I am a Pastry Chef, Entrepreneur, [TEDx Speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty-inz18kzQ), Programmer and Designer! 

Starting out as an iOS developer, I scaled my app WrapItUp to 3M+ users without a single dollar in marketing! Read more about it on my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@kinngh/refusing-20m-in-acquisition-1-5m-users-and-the-story-of-how-i-built-it-all-for-99-year-1351e624e62f?source=---------3------------------).

I also write a lot of back-end Node.js and Express code from text parsers to full fledged REST APIs. I also have started writing React.js and GraphQL content to complete my Full Stack + iOS developer goals.

I mentor start-ups with their business models and tech stack, and help them raise their seed rounds when I am not baking (yes, I am a Pastry Chef) or jumping off cliffs (with a parachute, of course).
